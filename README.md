## Motivation
Managing Git repositories via the command line can be complex and time-consuming, and existing GUI tools are often locked behind paywalls. Additionally, setting up new projects from scratch can be tedious and error-prone. GHOST eliminates these barriers by combining a user-friendly Git interface with an intuitive *scaffolding system* for rapid project initialization.

## Features
- *Graphical Git Interface*: Push, commit, merge branches, and create pull requests seamlessly.
- *Project Scaffolding (ScaffFolder)*: Quickly generate projects by selecting a frontend, backend, ORM, and database—eliminating the hassle of manual setup.
- *Local CI/CD Execution*: Fetch workflows from repositories and execute them locally with results displayed in real-time.
- *Personal GitHub Tracker*: Monitor repository activity, track contributions, and manage branches efficiently.
- *Redis Volume Mounts Caching*: Accelerates Git operations by caching local repositories and Git logs for improved performance.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Docker
- Git

### Setup
Run the following command to start GHOST:
sh
 docker run ghost-tool


## Usage
- *Project Scaffolding*: Use ScaffFolder to create fully configured projects in seconds—just choose your tech stack, and GHOST sets everything up.
- *Manage Repositories*: Utilize the graphical interface to push, commit, merge, and track changes.
- *Run Workflows*: Execute CI/CD workflows locally without needing to push changes to GitHub.
- *Monitor Git Logs*: View repository activity with Redis-based caching for optimized performance.
