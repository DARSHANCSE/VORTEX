### *STACKD*  
Scaffolding Tool for Accelerated Code Kickstart & Deployment  

## What is STACKD?  
STACKD is a CLI-based scaffolding tool that helps developers instantly set up a full-stack application with customizable configurations. It allows you to define your project name, frontend and backend ports, preferred tech stack, database, ORM, and authentication method. With a single command, STACKD generates a production-ready project with authentication and deployment configurations pre-integrated.  

## Motivation  
Setting up a full-stack project can be tedious and repetitive. Choosing the right frameworks, setting up authentication, configuring databases, and managing deployment files takes time. STACKD aims to simplify this process by providing a boilerplate generator that caters to every possible stack, making it easier for developers to jump straight into development.  

## âœ¨ Features  
âœ… *Full-stack Ready* â€“ Generates a complete project structure with frontend and backend setup.  
âœ… *Customizable* â€“ Choose your preferred frontend framework (React, Next.js, Vue, Svelte), backend (Express, NestJS, Fastify, Django), database (PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB), and ORM (Prisma, TypeORM, Sequelize).  
âœ… *Built-in Authentication* â€“ Supports NextAuth.js, Passport.js, Auth.js, Firebase Auth, and more.  
âœ… *Pre-configured Deployment* â€“ Includes a vercel.json file for Express deployments, along with Docker support.  
âœ… *One-command Setup* â€“ Instantly bootstraps a project with all selected configurations.  
âœ… *Extensible* â€“ Open-source and flexible to accommodate additional integrations.

## Usage  
1. Run the CLI:
